# CommandRegex

Simple velocity proxy plugin that allows vim-like search and replace functionality on player sent commands through regex.
For example, you might want to allow players to use a `/lobby` command instead of having to type the longer, `/server lobby` command.

**Note:** because this plugin modifies commands sent by the user, it is **NOT** compatible with chat-signing, as chat packets are modified in between client and server.
For this reason, it **requires** that downstream servers have `NoChatReports`, or a similar mod, installed.

## Usage

Download the latest release from the releases tab, and place it in the `plugins/` folder, and then installed the required dependencies:

### Proxy-side dependencies

1. [UnSignedVelocity](https://modrinth.com/plugin/unsignedvelocity): removes signed information from commands and messages sent by clients at the proxy level: allows us to modify player commands.
2. [VPacketEvents](https://modrinth.com/plugin/vpacketevents): UnSignedVelocity dependency.

### Server-side dependencies

1. [NoChatReports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports/): Allows the server to receive non-signed and invalid messages. Only server installation required, no need to also use it in clients.

Start the proxy, and edit the `commandregex/config.toml` file created under the `plugins/` directory.

## Configuration

Sample config file:

```toml
aliases = [
    { accept = "^gmc$", replace = "gamemode creative" }
]
```

The `accept` field represents the regex that must be matched for a certain command to be replaced.
Do **NOT** include the leading `/` character here.
You must use the `^` and `$` beginning and end of string to match the command, unless you want to replace text in the middle of commands.
You may use capture groups in the `accept` regex, which you may then use in the `replace` field by using `\n` where `n` is the capture group number, similar to vim's `:s` command.
For example:

```toml
aliases = [
    { accept = "^go (\w*)$", replace = "server \1" }
]
```

may be used to alias the `server` command to a similar, `go` commands, that captures the first argument, and then uses it to send the player to that server.
Note that this plugin does **not** handle command permissions: it only changes player-sent commands in-place.
This plugin effectively works as an advanced aliaser, leaving commands permissions to the downstream receivers: the proxy in the case of proxy commands, or the server otherwise.
